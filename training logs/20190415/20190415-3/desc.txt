Arch: ResNet Style with KernelNum 64, adding log prior
Loss: all-way-binary-crossentropy
Metrics: single_accuracy (only calculate accuracy for the voxel in question)
Optimizer: Adam with learning rate set to 1e-4, reducing learning rate on a plateau (patience 5), clipnorm=None
Regularizer: L2 (1e-4), Dropout (0.3)
