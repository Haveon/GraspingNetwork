Arch: First 10 residual blocks from ResNet50 followed by 5 residual conv blocks. Then expand to volume and apply 3 residual 3Dconv blocks (64-256-64)
Loss: all-way-binary-crossentropy
Metrics: single_accuracy (only calculate accuracy for the voxel in question)
Optimizer: SGD with learning rate set to 1e-3, momentum set to 0.9
Regularizer: L2 (1e-4)
